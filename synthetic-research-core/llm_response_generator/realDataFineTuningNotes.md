# Real Data Fine-Tuning Notes

# Fine-Tuning Plan

## Objective
Reduce divergence between synthetic and real responses over time.

## Steps
1. Tag survey responses with demographic + behavioral metadata.
2. Cluster synthetic vs real responses using embeddings (e.g., OpenAI or HuggingFace).
3. Quantify distance and bias dimensions.
4. Retrain or fine-tune models on residuals.
5. Validate improvement using fidelity scoring metrics (see validation layer).

## Notes
- Start with a small labeled dataset (n=200-500).
- Monitor sentiment, length, and topic coherence across both real and synthetic outputs.
