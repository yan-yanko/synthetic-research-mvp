# Synthetic Investor Feedback Platform

## Purpose

This platform helps startup founders simulate high-quality investor feedback on their pitch materials. Founders can upload their elevator pitch and pitch deck, and the system returns structured, role-specific responses from synthetic VC personas.

This is not a toy. It's a fundraising decision-support engine built on top of LLMs, driven by real investor patterns, and designed to help founders clarify their pitch before stepping into real meetings.

## Current Features

- Upload a **pitch deck (PDF)** and **elevator pitch (text)**
- Parse and analyze pitch materials
- Match to the most relevant **synthetic investor persona**
- Generate realistic feedback via GPT-4:
  - Strengths
  - Risks
  - Would they take the next meeting?

## Coming Soon

- Real-world VC and angel recommendations (via OpenVC / Crunchbase)
- Notion-style feedback export
- User authentication + saved feedback history
- Pricing plans (pay-per-feedback or credit system)

## Development Philosophy

- Keep core prompt structures modular
- Match to realistic personas (seed, angel, growth)
- Build general-purpose synthetic engine under a focused use case
- Avoid overfitting â€” every system component is adaptable to future verticals (e.g., buyer simulation, onboarding testing, product research)

## Status

- ðŸŸ¢ Functional MVP complete: Upload + simulate investor response
- ðŸŸ¡ Integration in progress: investor recommendation
- ðŸ”´ Not started: user auth, export, pricing

## Development Notes

### Error Logging

Frontend errors are logged via POST to `/api/log-error`:
- Captures message, stack, route, and input
- Stored in backend logs (console for now)

This helps debug production issues (like fetch failures or missing endpoints).
